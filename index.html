        <h2 class="tighter">Bio:</h2>

        <p>The Tubes are a San Francisco-based rock band. Their eponymous 1975 debut album included the single "White
            Punks
            on Dope," while their 1983 single "She's a Beauty" was a top-10 U.S. hit and its music video was frequently
            played in the early days of MTV. The band also performed in the 1980 film Xanadu, singing the rock portion
            of
            the cross-genre song "Dancin'" opposite a big band.
        </p>

        <p>The Tubes formed in 1972 in San Francisco, California, featuring members from two Phoenix, Arizona, bands who
            had
            relocated to San Francisco in 1969. One, The Beans, included Bill Spooner, Rick Anderson, Vince Welnick,
            Frank
            Martinez, Scott Hornbeck and Bob Macintosh. The other, the Red White and Blues Band, featured Prairie
            Prince,
            Roger Steen, and David Killingsworth. After performing at Expo '70 in Japan, Killingsworth left the Red,
            White
            and Blues Band, leaving Steen and Prince to audition new bass players, albeit unsuccessfully. Before moving
            to
            San Francisco the Beans had been a local favorite in Phoenix, selling out shows with a tongue-in-cheek
            concept
            rock show called "The Mother of Ascension" featuring costumes and props. After moving, Bill Spooner worked
            at
            the Fillmore West sweeping floors in between Beans shows at the Longshoremen's Hall and other minor venues.
            The
            band's loud, heavy jamming style didn't attract attention, and the band needed to go back home to Phoenix.
            There
            they would sell out shows, which provided enough money to pay their rent. The Beans' manager and former
            Alice
            Cooper Group drummer, John Speer, suggested they add Prince and Steen along with their roadie John Waybill
            to
            one of these shows. Waybill's nickname among the band was "Fee," short for "Fiji," thanks to his copious
            head of
            hippie hair.
